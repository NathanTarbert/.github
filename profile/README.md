BoxyHQ helps developers automate product security, and it provides low-code APIs to enable enterprise-compliant security via simple and efficient integrations. Including SAML SSO, audit logs, directory sync, and privacy vault.

Through its commercial open source shift left approach it intends to become the leading Developer Security platform; think of it as an extension of your security team or your security team if you don't have one.
